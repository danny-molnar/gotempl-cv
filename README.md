## What is this?

This is my online CV, open sourced here on GitHub for anyone to see. It's a work in progress, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it.

This is based on the GoTH stack (minus HTMX as I'm not using it here).

## Why did I make this?

I wanted to have a place where I could showcase my achievements and skills in a way that was more interactive than a traditional CV. I also wanted to learn how to use the GoTH stack, and this seemed like a good way to do it. All credit to the current design and layout goes to https://github.com/KonradSzwarc/devscard - I've made some changes, but the core design is his.

## How can I use this?

You can fork this repo and use it as a template for your own CV. You can also use it as a learning resource to see how the GoTH stack works.

All the data used to generate the CV is stored the yaml files in the `./public/data` directory. You can edit these files to add your own data.

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure you adhere to the types defined in `./pkgs/types` when adding data to the yaml files. This is to ensure that the data is displayed correctly on the CV.

## How can I contribute?

If you see any issues with the code, or have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
